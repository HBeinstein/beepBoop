## Description:

_This program was created as a way to practice arrays and looping. A user is able to enter a number as an input, and the program will count up to that number and add the results to the page. Numbers that contain a 1 will be replaced by the word "beep", numbers that contain a 2 will be replaced by the word "boop" and numbers that contain a 3 will be replaced by the phrase "Won't you be my neighbor?". If a number contains multiples of these digits, the program will prioritize the number 3 over the number 2, and the number 2 over the number 1._
